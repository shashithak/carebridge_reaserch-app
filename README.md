Project Overview
The CareBridge Platform is an IoT-based automated patient care system designed to enhance healthcare experiences and outcomes. By integrating smart technologies, the platform delivers personalized and efficient solutions across various domains of health management. The platform comprises the following modules:

Behavior Analysis
Critical Alerts Management
MindCare Assist
Food Calorie Tracker
Modules and Features
1. Behavior Analysis
Objective:
To monitor and analyze patients' daily activities and detect behavioral anomalies that may indicate health risks.

Key Features:

Real-time activity tracking using wearable devices.
Anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms.
Data visualization to highlight patterns and irregularities.
Applications:

Early detection of mental health issues.
Support for elderly care and remote monitoring.
2. Critical Alerts Management
Objective:
To promptly notify caregivers and medical professionals about critical health events.

Key Features:

IoT-based sensor integration for continuous monitoring of vitals (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure).
Alert system for emergencies such as sudden drops in vitals.
Multi-channel alert delivery (SMS, email, app notifications).
Applications:

Timely response to emergencies.
Enhances patient safety, especially for those with chronic illnesses.
3. MindCare Assist
Objective:
To support mental health through mood analysis, ADHD focus aids, and sleep optimization.

Key Features:

Mood-Responsive Environment Adjustment:
Tracks physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate variability).
Smart lighting and music therapies tailored to mood and mental health needs.
ADHD Focus Support System:
Cognitive training tasks with real-time performance feedback.
Sleep Optimization:
Monitors sleep patterns and optimizes wake-up timing.
Adapts therapies based on user feedback.
Applications:

Enhances mental well-being.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
